# This is a primitive version of a utube downloader  
so far it only supports my needs for today
feel free to tweak it to your personal prefrences

it downloads the videos ( of "720p" res or less ) of a playlist not much of folder structure  or GUI so far 
might add'em when im free

( also there is no handling of parrallel downloads from my side )

## To get Started : 
```
> git clone https://github.com/ACHREF999/utubeDownloader.git
```
```
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> python main.py
```
enter your url and it will download
